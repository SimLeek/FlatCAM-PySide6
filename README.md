FlatCAM: 2D Computer-Aided PCB Manufacturing
============================================

(c) 2014-2016 Juan Pablo Caram

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.

----

* Alignment drills created by the double sided pcb tool should have details from that tool and should re-open it in the tools tab so that the user can flip other parts of the board
* Add travel speed that's separate from drill speed (for drilling mounting holes and harder boards).
  * Put this in the FlatCAMGUI under other travel speed:
```Python
self.drill_feedrate_entry = LengthEntry()
grid1.addWidget(self.drill_feedrate_entry, 2, 1)

tfrlabel = QtWidgets.QLabel('Travel Feed Rate:')
tfrlabel.setToolTip(
  "Tool speed while traveling\n"
  "(in units per minute)."
)
grid1.addWidget(tfrlabel, 3, 0)
self.travel_feedrate_entry = LengthEntry()
grid1.addWidget(self.travel_feedrate_entry, 3, 1)
```
  * search for on_generate buttons and update to include
  * search for .gcode in camlib.py and modify it to include drill F feedrate command before z cutting, and travel F after
